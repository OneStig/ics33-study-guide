# ICS 33 Study Guide

This repository is an interactive study guide in a series of python notebooks corresponding to each ICS 33 lecture. Each section is my summarization of the [notes and examples](https://ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics33/Notes/), although some things that are especially important are essentially copy pasted. Each section also contains some useful practice questions for final prep.
