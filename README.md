# ICS 33 Study Guide

This repository is an interactive version of my lecture notes in python notebooks (or pdf, see below). It's basically a shortened version (but still kinda long) of [notes and examples](https://ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics33/Notes/) with some of my thoughts/experimenting included.

Clone into the repository to interact with the notebooks, or simply read [this generated pdf](https://github.com/OneStig/ics33-study-guide/raw/main/ics33_study_guide.pdf)
