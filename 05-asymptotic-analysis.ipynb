    "Part of writing code, is we want to write code that is efficient. Two important metrics we care about are space (memory usage), and time. We could analyze every single line of code down to it's very last detail, accounting for how fast our processor may be and try to precisely estimate how much time something will take, however we won't always have access to all this information (such as what computer our code will run on, or what our input sizes look like). Thus, we use asymptotic analysis to measure the _complexity_ of code, which allows us to compare different algorithms assuming our input size can get really large."

    "By definition, $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ _if and only if_ there are positive constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \\le cg(n) \\forall n \\ge n_0$. Which is just simply saying, ignoring constant factors, as $n$ gets really big, $f(n)$ will always be less than $g(n)$. This makes sense, because when we can't identify small things that affect constant factor like how long it takes to perform an addition operation, we can more about the big picture, as in how do the growth rate of different functions compare as $n$ gets really large."
